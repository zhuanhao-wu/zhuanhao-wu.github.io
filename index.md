Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the ECE department, University of Waterloo (UWaterloo).
My supervisor is Professor Hiren Patel.
I work in the area of computer architecture with specific interests in cache coherence in safety-critical systems architecture, hardware design, hardware security, and compilers.

I received my Masters in Applied Sciences (MASc) from UWaterloo in 2019. My MASc thesis was about the design and evaluation of physical unclonable functions using compositions.

I used to compete in ACM/ICPC, winning silver medals in Asian Regonals.
